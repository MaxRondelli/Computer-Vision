# First Computer Vision Laboratory
In the first Computer Vision laboratory we've seen an OpenCV introducation. We have seen how to use cv2 functions to manipulate images and how play with RBG colors. 

We also compute Spatial Filtering and Edge Filtering, applying the knowledge seen during the theory lessons. 

An homework has been assigned by the professor, which was to add Gaussian Noise to Lenna picture and see plot the result.
